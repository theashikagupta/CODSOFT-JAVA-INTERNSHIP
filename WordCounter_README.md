# Word Counter

This Java project implements a simple word counting application that allows users to count the number of words in either a provided text or a file.

## Overview

The Word Counter program provides functionality to count the total number of words in text input or a file. Users can choose between inputting text directly or providing a file path for word counting.

## How to Use

1. Run the `WordCounter.java` file to start the application.
2. Choose between entering text or providing a file path for word counting.
   - To input text, enter 'text' when prompted and type the text.
   - To input a file, enter 'file' when prompted and provide the file path.
3. The program will display the total count of words based on the input provided.

## File Input Example
Enter 'text' to input text or 'file' to input a file path:
file
Enter file path:
C:\Users\Username\Documents\sample.txt
Total words in the text/file: 26


## Features

- Count the total number of words in provided text or a file.
- Accept text input or a file path for word counting.

## Enhancements

- **Ignore Common Words**: Implement functionality to ignore common words or stop words from the word count.
- **Display Additional Statistics**: Extend the program to display statistics like the number of unique words or the frequency of each word.
- **Improve Input Validation**: Enhance input validation to handle empty inputs or invalid file paths gracefully.
