# Address Book System

This Java project implements a basic address book system allowing users to manage contacts through a console-based interface.

## Overview

The Address Book System consists of two main classes: `Contact` and `AddressBook`. 
- `Contact` represents individual contacts with attributes such as name, phone number, and email address.
- `AddressBook` manages the collection of contacts, allowing users to add, remove, search, and display contacts.

## Features

- Add new contacts with name, phone number, and email address.
- Remove existing contacts from the address book.
- Search for a contact by name.
- Display all contacts currently stored in the address book.
- Console-based user interface for interaction.

## How to Use

1. Compile the Java files.
2. Run the `AddressBookSystem.java` file to start the address book system.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform actions like adding, searching, or displaying contacts.

## Enhancements

- **Input Validation**: Currently, the system lacks input validation. Enhance the system to validate user inputs for correct formats and handle edge cases.
- **Storage Integration**: Implement methods to read and write contact data to a file or a database for persistence between sessions.
- **User Interface Improvements**: Consider enhancing the user interface by utilizing libraries for a more interactive experience.
