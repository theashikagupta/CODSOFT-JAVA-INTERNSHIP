# Student Management System

This Java project implements a basic Student Management System allowing users to manage student information through a console-based interface.

## Overview

The Student Management System consists of two main classes: `Student` and `StudentManagementSystem`.
- `Student` represents individual students with attributes such as name, roll number, and grade.
- `StudentManagementSystem` manages the collection of students, providing methods to add, remove, search, and display student information.

## Features

- Add new students with name, roll number, and grade.
- Remove existing students from the management system.
- Search for a student by roll number.
- Display all students currently stored in the system.
- Console-based user interface for interaction.

## How to Use

1. Compile the Java files.
2. Run the `StudentManagementSystemApp.java` file to start the student management system.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform actions like adding, searching, or displaying student information.

## Enhancements

- **Input Validation**: Currently, the system lacks input validation. Enhance the system to validate user inputs for correct formats and handle edge cases.
- **Storage Integration**: Implement methods to read and write student data to a file or a database for persistence between sessions.
- **User Interface Improvements**: Consider enhancing the user interface by utilizing libraries for a more interactive experience.
